## 2. Feature Selection Rationale

### 2.1 Primary Risk Indicators (High Weight)

**Activity Risk (20% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Wallets with no DeFi history represent unknown risk profiles
- **Implementation**: Graduated scoring based on transaction frequency
- **Business Logic**: Lending protocols require track record for risk assessment

**Liquidation Risk (25% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Historical liquidations are the strongest predictor of future risk
- **Implementation**: Direct penalty system (300 points per liquidation, capped at 100)
- **Business Logic**: Past liquidations indicate poor risk management

### 2.2 Portfolio Risk Indicators (Medium Weight)

**Borrowing Behavior Risk (15% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: High borrowing ratios indicate aggressive leverage strategies
- **Implementation**: Ratio of borrow operations to total operations
- **Thresholds**: >60% = High Risk, 30-60% = Medium Risk, <30% = Low Risk

**Concentration Risk (15% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Lack of diversification increases portfolio volatility
- **Implementation**: Count of unique Compound contracts used
- **Thresholds**: 1 contract = High Risk, 2-3 = Medium Risk, 4+ = Low Risk

**Portfolio Balance Risk (10% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Extreme behaviors (only borrowing/only supplying) indicate imbalanced strategies
- **Implementation**: Analysis of supply vs. borrow operation patterns

### 2.3 Behavioral Risk Indicators (Low Weight)

**Transaction Size Risk (5% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Very large transactions may indicate institutional or whale behavior
- **Implementation**: Average transaction value analysis in ETH

**Account Age Risk (5% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Very new accounts lack established track records
- **Implementation**: Days between first and last Compound interaction

**Frequency Risk (5% Weight)**
- **Rationale**: Unusual transaction patterns may indicate automated strategies
- **Implementation**: Transaction frequency per day analysis

## 3. Scoring Method

### 3.1 Individual Risk Factor Calculation
- **Scale**: Each risk factor scored 0-100 points
- **Direction**: Higher scores indicate higher risk
- **Methodology**: Threshold-based scoring with graduated penalties

### 3.2 Weighted Aggregation
Final Score = Σ(Risk Factor × Weight)
Where weights sum to 1.0:

Activity Risk: 0.20
Liquidation Risk: 0.25
Borrowing Risk: 0.15
Concentration Risk: 0.15
Balance Risk: 0.10
Size Risk: 0.05
Time Risk: 0.05
Frequency Risk: 0.05

### 3.3 Normalization and Scaling
- **Method**: MinMaxScaler applied to normalize to 0-1000 range
- **Floor**: Minimum score of 1 (no wallet has zero risk)
- **Ceiling**: Maximum score of 1000 (highest risk)
- **Distribution**: Linear scaling preserves relative risk rankings

### 3.4 Score Interpretation
- **0-300**: Low Risk (Conservative DeFi users with established track records)
- **301-600**: Medium Risk (Moderate activity with some risk factors)
- **601-1000**: High Risk (Aggressive strategies, no activity, or red flags)

## 4. Risk Indicators Justification

### 4.1 Why Liquidation History is Weighted Highest (25%)
**Business Rationale:**
- Direct evidence of past risk management failure
- Strong predictor of future liquidation probability
- Industry standard: Credit scoring prioritizes payment defaults

**Statistical Support:**
- Academic research shows liquidation events cluster (users who get liquidated once are more likely to be liquidated again)
- Compound protocol documentation emphasizes liquidation risk as primary concern

### 4.2 Why No Activity Receives High Risk Scores
**Business Rationale:**
- Unknown behavior patterns present uncertainty
- No track record for risk assessment
- Could indicate dormant or compromised accounts
- Conservative approach appropriate for lending protocols

**Implementation Logic:**
- 51.5% of wallets (53/103) had no Compound activity
- These wallets received high risk scores (typically 600-1000)
- Protects protocol from unknown entities

### 4.3 Why Borrowing Behavior Matters (15% Weight)
**Risk Theory:**
- High borrowing ratios indicate leverage usage
- Leverage amplifies both gains and losses
- Over-leveraged positions more susceptible to liquidation

**Practical Application:**
- Borrowing >60% of operations = aggressive strategy
- Pure borrowers (no supplying) = unbalanced risk profile
- Conservative lenders receive lower risk scores

### 4.4 Why Portfolio Concentration is Critical (15% Weight)
**Financial Principle:**
- Diversification reduces portfolio risk
- Single-asset exposure increases volatility
- Multi-protocol users demonstrate sophistication

**Implementation:**
- Users of 4+ contracts = diversified (lower risk)
- Users of 1 contract = concentrated (higher risk)
- Reflects modern portfolio theory principles
